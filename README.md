# Book-Recommendation-System
## Project Overview
  Collaborative filtering is a type of recommender system that uses user interactions and data to filter information and make automatic predictions about a user's interests. It works by grouping users based on their behavior and similar preferences, and then recommending items to a user based on how other users with similar interests have interacted with those items. The idea behind collaborative filtering is that people who agree on their evaluation of certain items are likely to agree again in the future.
## Problem Statement
  The goal of a collaborative-based recommendation system is to recommend items to a user based on the similarity with other users by collecting preferences from many users with similar taste.
  In this data I develop a program to recommend the books for the  user’s that similar to their post-reading books and based on similar behavior, recommending new items according to group characteristics. 
  These systems aim to suggest items or resources that are most relevant to the user's interests and needs.
## Algorithm Handling
  I will do some pre processing and feature engineering steps to enhance the performance of the models. The algorithms analyze previous information about the users and recommend the similar books.
  I use KNN algorithm in machine learning to recommend books for user based on similar group characteristics.
	It groups users based on similar behavior, recommending new items according to group characteristics. It will predict what user will like based on the similarity with other users by collecting preferences from many users with similar taste.
