# Book-Recommendation-System
## Project Overview
Collaborative filtering is a type of recommender system that uses user interactions and data to filter information and make automatic predictions about a user's interests. It works by grouping users based on their behavior and similar preferences, and then recommending items to a user based on how other users with similar interests have interacted with those items. The idea behind collaborative filtering is that people who agree on their evaluation of certain items are likely to agree again in the future.
